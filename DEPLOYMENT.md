## Troubleshooting

### If you still see a white screen:

1. **Check the browser console:**
   - Right-click â†’ "Inspect" â†’ "Console" tab
   - Look for any red error messages

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

3. **Try a different browser:**
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

4. **Check the deployment logs:**
   - In Netlify/Vercel dashboard, check the deployment logs

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Errors**: Make sure you're deploying the `build` folder, not the entire project
2. **Build Errors**: Run `npm run build` locally first to check for issues
3. **CORS Issues**: Usually not a problem with static hosting
