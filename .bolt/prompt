Use a modern, clean design system that matches 21st.dev’s aesthetic: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + lucide icons. 
Follow these rules consistently:
- Grid-based layouts with proper spacing (8/16/24 px rhythm). 
- Rounded-2xl corners on cards, inputs, and buttons. 
- Soft shadows (shadow-md to shadow-lg) for depth. 
- Responsive design: mobile-first, then scale up to desktop. 
- Use shadcn/ui components for buttons, inputs, dialogs, tabs, dropdowns, tables, sidebars, and modals. 
- Use lucide-react icons for all UI icons. 
- Keep typography minimal and modern (font sizes: sm/base/lg/xl/2xl). 
- Navigation should use a top app bar + optional left sidebar. 
- Consistent color system: neutral grays for backgrounds, 21st-style accent color for primary actions. 
Never break the functional logic or API connections — only refactor the UI to follow this system.
