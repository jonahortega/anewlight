# Greek Life App Redesign

This is a redesign version of the Greek Life application, created as a copy of the original working version for experimental redesign work.

## Purpose
This directory contains a complete copy of the original Greek Life application (`greek-life-getting-there`) that has been set aside specifically for redesign work. The original version remains untouched and functional.

## What's Different
- **Project Name**: `greek-life-redesign` (vs `theGreekLifeapp`)
- **Version**: 2.0.0 (vs 1.0.0)
- **Description**: Modern redesign of the Greek life platform
- **Startup Script**: `start-greek-life-redesign.sh`

## Current Status
This version contains the same code as the original working version, but is ready for:
- Feed redesign
- UI/UX improvements
- New features
- Experimental changes

## How to Use
1. **Original Version**: Located at `../greek-life-getting-there/` - Keep this for reference and fallback
2. **Redesign Version**: This directory - Use for all redesign work
3. **Start the redesign**: `./start-greek-life-redesign.sh`

## Safety
- The original version is completely preserved
- All changes made here are isolated to this copy
- You can always reference the original for comparison
- If redesign doesn't work out, you can always go back to the original

## Next Steps
Ready for feed redesign and other improvements!
